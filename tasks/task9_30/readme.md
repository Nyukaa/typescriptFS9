## 🚀 Overview

Patientor is a simplified electronic medical record system that allows users to:

- Browse patients
- View detailed patient information
- Manage multiple medical entry types
- Add new entries with validated, type-safe forms

The project was built as part of **Full Stack Open (Part 9)** and demonstrates **production-style TypeScript usage** on both frontend and backend.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

**Frontend**

- React + Vite
- TypeScript (strict)
- Material UI
- React Router
- Axios

**Backend**

- Node.js
- Express
- TypeScript
- Zod (runtime validation)

---

## 🧠 Problem Solving & Engineering Decisions

### 1. Complex Domain Modeling with TypeScript

- Designed **discriminated unions** for medical entries:
  - HealthCheck
  - Hospital
  - OccupationalHealthcare
- Used exhaustive `switch` checks with `never` to guarantee compile-time safety when rendering entries.

### 2. End-to-End Type Safety

- Shared and aligned types between frontend and backend.
- Prevented invalid data at compile time and runtime using **Zod schemas**.

### 3. Scalable State Management

- Local UI state handled with `useState`
- Global diagnoses data managed via **Context + useReducer**
- Clear separation between UI state and domain state.

### 4. UX-Driven Validation

- Backend validation with meaningful error messages.
- Frontend forms improved to prevent invalid input:
  - Date inputs instead of free text
  - Multi-select diagnosis codes
  - Restricted health rating values

### 5. Deployment Constraints

- Solved frontend–backend integration by:
  - Serving Vite build from Express
  - Using relative API paths (`/api`) for production
- Enabled smooth local dev via Vite proxy.
